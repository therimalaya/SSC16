	Abstract = {Data science is generating enormous amounts of data, and new
                  and advanced analytical methods are constantly being developed
                  to cope with the challenge of extracting information from such
                  ``big-data''. Researchers often use simulated data to assess
                  and document the properties of these new methods, and in this
                  paper we present an extension to the R-package simrel, which
                  is a versatile and transparent tool for simulating linear
                  model data with an extensive range of adjustable properties.
                  The method is based on the concept of relevant components, and
                  is equivalent to the newly developed envelope model. It is a
                  multi-response extension of R-package simrel which is
                  available in R-package repository CRAN, and as simrel the new
                  approach is essentially based on random rotations of latent
                  relevant components to obtain a predictor matrix X, but in
                  addition we introduce random rotations of latent components
                  spanning a response space in order to obtain a multivariate
                  response matrix Y. The properties of the linear relation
                  between X and Y are defined by a small set of input parameters
                  which allow versatile and adjustable simulations. Sub-space
                  rotations also allow for generating data suitable for testing
                  variable selection methods in multi-response settings. The
                  method is implemented as an update to the R-package simrel.},

	Abstract = {We introduce envelopes for simultaneously reducing the
                  predictors and the responses in multivariate linear
                  regression, so the regression then depends only on estimated
                  linear combinations of X and Y. We use a likelihood-based
                  objective function for estimating envelopes and then propose
                  algorithms for estimation of a simultaneous envelope as well
                  as for basic Grassmann manifold optimization. The asymptotic
                  properties of the resulting estimator are studied under
                  normality and extended to general distributions. We also
                  investigate likelihood ratio tests and information criteria
                  for determining the simultaneous envelope dimensions.
                  Simulation studies and real data examples show substantial
                  gain over the classical methods, like partial least squares,
                  canonical correlation analysis, and reduced-rank regression.

	Abstract = {Partial least squares regression has been a very popular
                  method for prediction, first used by chemometricians, but also
                  now by statisticians in a number of applied fields. The method
                  can in a natural way be connected to a statistical model which
                  now has been ex- tended and further developed in terms of an
                  envelope model. Concentrating on the uni- variate case, the
                  model is here approached from several points of view. Several
                  estimators of the regression vector in this model are defined,
                  including the ordinary PLS estimator, the maximum likelihood
                  envelope estimator and a recently proposed Bayes PLS
                  estimator. The different estimators are compared with respect
                  to prediction error by systematic sim- ulations. The main
                  conclusion from the simulations seems to be that Bayes PLS
                  performs well compared to the other methods in virtually all
                  cases.},

                  particular, we establish an envelope as the nucleus of both
                  univariate and multivariate PLS, which opens the door to
                  pursuing the same goals as PLS but using different envelope
                  estimators. It is argued that a likelihood-based envelope
                  estimator is less sensitive to the number of PLS components
                  that are selected and that it outperforms PLS in prediction
                  and estimation.},

Researchers and data scientists often introduce new methods and evaluate them based on various aspects of data. However, studies on the impact of/on a model with multiple response variables are limited. This study compares some newly-developed (envelope) and well-established (PLS, PCR) prediction methods based on real data and simulated data specifically designed by varying properties such as multicollinearity, the correlation between multiple responses and position of relevant principal components of predictors. This study aims to give some insight into these methods and help the researcher to understand and use them in further studies."
